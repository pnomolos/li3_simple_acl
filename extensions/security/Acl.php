/**
 * `Lightweight ACL model`
 * Burden is on defining the rules where the `resources` are located:
 * `routes`, `models` and even `collection` row
 *
 * `Description`
 * `User`.`role` needs to be set in the User model
 * Then permissions need to be defined and stored at the resource level.
 *
 * In routes, simply put the list of roles allowed to access a route
 * in an array. Then call the isAllowed method.
 *
 * For the most part, the roles in the `User` collection need to match the
 * permissions. You can call them 'foo' if you like. As long as they match.
 *
 * However, there are three special permissions: `owner`, `user` and
 * 'any'.
 *
 * For `owner`, you need $perms['owner'] to match the $user['id']. If so,
 * permission is granted. See "Usage" for details.
 *
 * For `user`, permission will be granted as long as the $user array exists.
 * It's really a duplicate for the Auth::check built into Lithium so I'm
 * thinking of getting rid of this. Feedback appreciated.
 *
 * For 'any', permission will always be granted.
 *
 * @see /app/models/Activity.php for an example of setting permission on fields
